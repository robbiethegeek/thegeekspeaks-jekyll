So the [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) of this blog post is I am heading to the Department of Veteran's Affairs to work on [vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov).

I would really like to thank [Phase2](https://www.phase2technology.com/) for all of my time there, it is a company full of some of my closest friends and an amazing group of technologists.  I wish Phase2 nothing but the best on their super bright future and am so grateful for the opportunity that you offered and provided me.
