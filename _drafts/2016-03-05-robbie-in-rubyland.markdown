If you haven't ever attended an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) you are missing out on a truly unique technology event.  The short explaination is that the entire conference's sessions are organized and scheduled on the day of the event, and you as an attendee have a say in what topics and sessions are scheduled.  Over the years I have attended many unconference style events (a really interesting and exemplary example of the unconferences I attended was [BarCampNYC](https://twitter.com/barcampnyc)), I also ran and organized a few too ([DrupalCampNYC](http://www.drupalcamp.nyc/) and the [NOVA Node Unconference](http://www.meetup.com/Nova-Node/events/222312195/))
