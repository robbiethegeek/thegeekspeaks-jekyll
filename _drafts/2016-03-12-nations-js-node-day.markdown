Sessions

There was a great suggestion in the [DC Tech](https://dctech.slack.com/) backchannel (DC Tech [signup](http://dctechslack.herokuapp.com/)) to use a [hackpad](https://hackpad.com/) for shared notes throughout the event, so here is a link to the [Ruby Retrocession 2016 Notes](https://hackpad.com/RetroRuby-2016-LQp0Q1zqa6t).  I am super impressed with the organizers, the attendees and the vibe of the DC Metro area Ruby communities, warm, inviting, friendly, and real is the set of adjectives that come to mind.  Thanks to everyone involved for making this non-rubist become inspired to write more ruby, and keep attending your events.
