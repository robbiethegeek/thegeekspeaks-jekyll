I attend a lot of technology events, as an organizer, attendee, speaker, panelist or cheerleader.  Since the summer I have been asked to participate in a few different communities events, lucky enough to sit on panels, present and conduct informal mentoring.  As I mentioned in my previous blog post about [imposter syndrome](2017/09/22/imposter-syndrome.html), Black Code Collective, Optoro and Tech Talk DC all asked me to give that very important talk.  Since then I have

When friends of mine talked about creating a new technology meet up called [Black Code Collective](http://blackcodecollective.com/), they asked if I would be willing to speak at a future event.  I think I said yes before they finished asking, and eventually I was able to give my [imposter syndrome talk](https://www.meetup.com/Black-Code-Collective/events/238892737).  This led to one of the organizers asking me to come and give this talk within his company as part of their companies diversity & inclusion speaker series.  This was another great experience this time the audience was a mix of developers, and non-developers and some of the questions asked forced me to think about my own myopic view as a technologist and adjust my presentation. 

Last night I spoke at [Tech Talk DC](https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/) about imposter syndrome, I was happy to be able to give this talk again, I feel like every time I give it I find new things I should highlight and focus on, realized this time that I should add in a slide about my education and lack of college degree. I was pleasantly surprised to have a bunch of DC Metro friends in attendance, and even lucky enough that a few old NYC friends who were able to attend. Thanks to all who attended and I hope my talk helped to shine a light on the fact that most of us still think we are faking it and someone is going see us as the fraud we <i>know</i> we are.  Be kind to yourself, you are better then you think you are.

I was a panelist with Julie and Laura talking about Design, Tech and Government for a new series co-hosted by Spoke and NYCDA. These organizations went above and beyond for their inaugeral event, drawing a great crowd and providing the
